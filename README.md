 <h2>Task-2</h2>
  <p>So here I've created the small API which will takes array of string, here string basicallly expecting mathematical expression.</p>
  <p>You can check the running code locally as well as remotely as I've deployed this application on cyclic</p>
  
  <p>Local way:- first clone this repo</p>

 ```bash 
 git clone git@github.com:Prajyot1234/OnlineSalesAI-Task2.git
 npm i
 nodemon index.js
